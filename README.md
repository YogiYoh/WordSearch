Overview
Project is a word search algorithm that allows users to input a grid of letters and a list of words to search for within that grid. The program identifies the locations of the words, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


Limitations of the Project: 
  - No Array Notations ([])
  - Couldn't use any library functions to convert characters into lower and uppercase

Features: 
  - Displays the locations of the found word
  - Handles words in multiple orientations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)

How to execute: 
To execute the program, take out one of the '.txt' files in the "textfiles" directory and then type './wordsearch puzzle#.txt' in the terminal to run the word search algorithm on the specified puzzle file (replace # with the corresponding puzzle files). After running the program type your word, and it will read the grid of letters
from the file displaying the results in the terminal.
